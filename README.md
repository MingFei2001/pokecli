# pokecli

> üñºÔ∏è Show a random Pok√©mon ASCII art in your terminal, blazingly fast.

**Pokecli** is a tiny C program that prints a random Pok√©mon sprite every time you run it. Perfect for ricing, dotfiles, or just adding a bit of fun to your shell. *No dependencies, just pure speed.*

- üü¢ Random Pok√©mon ASCII art on every run
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Super fast, written in C
- üé® Great for screenshots and showing off your setup
- üêß Made for Linux (Debian), but easy to adapt

## Installation

Clone, build, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MingFei2001/pokecli.git --depth=1
cd pokecli
make
./pokecli
```

## Usage

- Run `./pokecli` for a random Pok√©mon.
- Run `./pokecli pikachu` to summon a specific one (currently only the first 151 is available üòì)
- Drop it in your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or your favorite rice script for instant joy.

## TODO

- [x] Random Pok√©mon by default
- [ ] Add a manpage
- [ ] Package for easy install
- [ ] Make a .deb package

## Contributing

I love ricing and I'm still learning C, so contributions, suggestions, and issues are super welcome! If you want to see pokecli on your distro or have ideas for new features, open an issue or PR.
